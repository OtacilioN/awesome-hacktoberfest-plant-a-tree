# Contribution Guidelines

Before you start contributing with this project make sure you read our [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/OtacilioN/awesome-hacktoberfest-plant-a-tree/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), it is really important to make this inclusive and open to everyone, otherwise, it would not be awesome_

We only have one planet earth and we need to take good care of it, for ourselves and for the next generations. 

So take the time to donate to an organisation that contributes to reforestation around the world, and help more people and find these institutions.
